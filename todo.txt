#TODO
* X Winery Bottling Spec Sheet - Make that shit shine
* TIO Bottling Sheet
* Authorization, flexible create w/ admin "Live"
* State on PackagingComponents
	* Admin State Change UI
	* Clean up AR queries to reference state when appropriate (erm, always?)
	* Default scopes would probably help here
	* PackagingComponents should know the cost of their inventory (add something to ComponentEvent)
* Add more analyses to Wines
	* Add attachments to wines? What would we attach?
* How do we walk projects through the State lifecycle? Drop-down inline on index table?
* Add logic for over-order amt? Or keep that a GM thing?

	
* Project packet ... this needs more thought
	* PO (applies to one or more projects) - no it doesnt
	* BOL (applies to one or more projects)
	
* 45 day threshold
	* packaging materials associated
	* wine sample associated
	
LETS THINK ABOUT HOW TO SORT THINGS
* Projects => Bottling Date
* Customers => Name ASC
* Vendors => Name ASC
* Wineries => Name ASC
* PurchaseOrders => Order date ASC (only open ones)
* Wines => Created_at DESC
* Components => Created_at DESC (these are wine components)
